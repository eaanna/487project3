        <div id="historydiv">
            <div class="history">
                <p>While TBIs have existed as long as man, treatment and research did not emerge until
                    the 19th and
                    20th centuries. Citing new techniques for head injury treatment in the American Civil War,
                    fatalities of TBIs
                    have dramatically decreased from then onward. During World War I, the presence of blast related
                    injuries allowed
                    scientists and doctors to gain an insight on how various brain injuries affect certain parts of the
                    brain.
                    In World War II, rehabilitation techniques for TBI victims were explored for the first time for
                    motor
                    difficulties. Research continued in the 20th century, and TBI awareness accelerated in the 1970s.
                    Shortly
                    after, groundbreaking medical advances, such as the MRI and the CT Scan, allowed doctors to more
                    accurately
                    pinpoint damage to the human brain.</p>
                <p>The 1990s and 2000s are considered the most important decades in the
                    history of brain injury. Due to the Persian Gulf, Iraq, and Afghanistan Wars, the US and other
                    militaries
                    were prompted to conduct research on blast related brain injuries, and the combination of the
                    injuries with
                    PTSD and the effect on the cognitive and motor functions in the body. Additionally, the 2000s
                    brought the
                    first diagnoses of CTE, otherwise known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, from athletes and
                    soldiers who
                    had obtained repeated head injuries years before and were suffering in older age due to the repeated
                    trauma.
                    The recentness of these discoveries makes TBI one of the most urgent topics in medicine, as the long
                    term
                    affects of brain injury and the commonality of injury is so expansive across all ages.</p>

            <h2>What is a TBI?</h2>
            <p>According to the CDC, "A TBI is caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head that disrupts the normal
                function
                of the brain. Not all blows or jolts to the head result in a TBI." TBI severity can vary from mild
                (otherwise known as a concussion or mTBI) to severe, and severity affects the overall damage to the
                brain.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="degrees">
            <h2>The degrees of a TBI</h2>
            <p>TBI's are categorized into mild, moderate, and severe. After head trauma, it is recommended to visit a
                doctor
                to ensure no permanent or severe damage occured; especially if any symptoms, such as headaches,
                difficulty
                thinking, or loss of consciousness occur. Symptoms fall into one of four categories:
                thinking/remembering,
                physical, emotion/mood, and sleep. Symptoms are used to evaluate a patient to determine the severity of
                the
                TBI.</p>

            <h2>In Youth</h2>
            <p>As a whole, children and the elderly are the most at-risk populations to suffer from a TBI. For the
                elderly, falls are most common, while children suffer from both falls and being struck by objects
                unintentionally. Many child emergency visits due to a TBI are attributed to sports, and the vast
                majority of diagnoses end up as mTBIs, known as concussions.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">As seen in the image, soccer uses a move called "heading"
                which invloves using the head to hit the ball mid-air. This move, as well as other moves in other
                contact and semi-contact sports, can increase the risk of a TBI due to impact. Regardless, football is
                still consistently the sport with the most emergency visits with a twenty-thousand plus lead against the
                second leading sport, basketball (data is from 2010-2016 in the US).</p>

        <p class="caption" style="text-align: center;">In the same time period (2010-2016), males consistently went to the ED at double the rate
            females did. For both males and females, ages 10-14 had the most visits, with surrounding data following a
            bell curve.</p>

                <p class="caption">In 2014, falls were the most common reason for emergency department visits associated
                    with
                    TBI. Young children (ages 0-4) and the elderly (65-75+) were the most at-risk to suffer from fall
                    related
                    TBIs. Being unintentionally struck by an object was second (such as a baseball), and motor vehicle accidents were third. As of recent years, the number of emergency department visits related to TBI have grown as a whole.

                    were
                    children ages 0-17. Only 3% (~23,000) ended up in hospitalizations and less than 1 percent of these
                    visits
                    result in death. It is important to note, however, that while many child TBIs are minor, it is known
                    that
                    repeated concussions are dangerous and can result in death or have long term effects, some of which
