        <h2>What is a TBI?</h2>
        <h2>The history of TBI understanding</h2>
        <p>While TBIs have existed as long as man, concrete treatment and research did not emerge until the 19th and
            20th century.Citing new techniques for head injury treatment in the American Civil War, fatalities of TBIs
            have decreased from then onward. During World War I, the presence of blast related injuries allowed
            scientists and doctors to gain an insight on how various brain injuries affect certain parts of the brain.
            In World War II, rehabilitation techniques for TBI victims were explored for the first time for motor
            difficulties. Research continued in the 20th century, and TBI awareness accelerated in the 1970s. Shortly
            after, groundbreaking medical advances, such as the MRI and the CT Scan, allowed doctors to more accurately
            pinpoint damage to the human brain. The 1990s and 2000s are considered the most important decades in the
            history of brain injury. Due to the Persian Gulf, Iraq, and Afghanistan Wars, the US and other militaries
            were prompted to conduct research on blast related brain injuries, and the combination of the injuries with
            PTSD and the effect on the cognitive and motor functions in the body. Additionally, the 2000s brought the
            first diagnoses of CTE, otherwise known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, from athletes and soldiers who
            had obtained repeated head injuries years before and were suffering in older age due to the repeated trauma.
            The recentness of these discoveries makes TBI one of the most urgent topics in medicine, as the long term
            affects of brain injury and the commonality of injury is so expansive across all ages.</p>

        <h2>In Youth</h2>
        <p>Youth go to the hospitals for concussions.</p>
        <div id="sport_chart"></div>
        <p>from 2010 to 2016, males consistently went to the ED at double the rate women did.</p>
        <div id="sport_age_chart"></div>
        <p>For both boys and girls, ages 10-14 had the most visits, with surrounding data following a bell curve.</p>
